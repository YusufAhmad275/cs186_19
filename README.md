## Introduction
I'm following teachyourselfcs curriculum, this are my resources for cs186 course
about Databases.

[teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#databases) for some reason advises 2015 version of this course. I think
projects from 2019 are better. Take a look! I might do both because 5 from 2015
is very interesting.

## Homework 2015
1. Project Gutenberg command-line wrangling
2. UDF Caching in Spark
3. Real-world SQL queries and scalable algorithms
4. Joins in Spark
5. Visualizing FEC Data
